# How to play
When you are on game screen, press ready and if both you and your friend are ready then the game begins.

The game is similar to High-Low. If you don't know what is High-Low then it is a very simple game where two players guess a random number in between 0-500. If your guess is below the random number then a text will appear saying "TOO LOW", if your guess is above the number then a text will appear saying "TOO HIGH". You your number matches the random number then you will win coins and can exchange coins with money.

# Tip-How to know it's your turn now?
On the top right side you can see a text "Guessing". It means that your friend is guessing and it's not your turn, it's your turn only when something else is shown except "Guessing"
